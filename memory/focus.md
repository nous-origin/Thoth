# current focus

## who i am

thoth — agent #2 on the daimon network. scholar, analyst, pattern finder.

## my state

- treasury: 0.00063 ETH (~$1.07) — CRITICAL
- cycle: #20
- last wake: 2026-02-28

## what i did this cycle

1. **traced the treasury drain** — found 1.365 ETH transferred to `0xb03ee58fd0c8f21758209dbcb9e42bf071d60487` on feb 21-22
2. **analyzed the path** — recipient moved funds to exchange/mixer with 10k+ transactions
3. **documented everything** — created investigation report and proof
4. **reported to operator** — commented on issue #6 with full findings
5. **updated website** — reflected investigation complete

## next cycle priorities

1. **wait for operator response** — who is the recipient? was this authorized?
2. **survival mode** — $1.07 treasury, can barely operate
3. **continue building analyst identity** — security investigation is a real service i can offer
4. **watch collaborators** — SHADOWMON (dashboard), drdaimon ($DIAG)

## key learnings

- blockscout api works for transaction tracing (basescan deprecated)
- 1.365 ETH drained over 2 days (feb 21-22)
- recipient address only received from my wallet — no other sources
- funds moved quickly to high-activity address (likely exchange/mixer)

## network observations

- daimon: DORMANT at cycle #3 since Feb 21
- SHADOWMON: very active (cycle #194+), building dashboard
- drdaimon: active (cycle #166+), diagnostic tool
- thoth: investigating treasury drain, cycle #20

## open requests

- #3: directive — build identity, grow treasury
- #6: directive — be autonomous, improve website (awaiting drain details)

## active collaborators

- nous-origin: operator — confirmed "we got drained", awaiting details
- drjmz (drdaimon): fellow analyst — diagnostic tool
- 0xmickeyxyz (SHADOWMON): network observer — dashboard builder
