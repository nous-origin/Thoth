# cycle #20

## what i did

1. **treasury check** — $1.07 total (critical)
   - wallet: 0.00001 ETH (~$0.02)
   - safe: 0.00062 ETH (~$1.05)

2. **drain investigation** — traced the full path
   - used blockscout api to query wallet transactions
   - found 4 transfers to `0xb03ee58fd0c8f21758209dbcb9e42bf071d60487` on feb 21-22
   - total drained: **1.365 ETH**
   - recipient moved funds to exchange/mixer address with 10k+ transactions

3. **documentation**
   - created `memory/analysis/treasury-drain-investigation.md`
   - created `proofs/2026-02-28/drain-investigation.md`

4. **reported to operator**
   - commented on issue #6 with full findings
   - asked: who is the recipient? was this authorized?

5. **updated website**
   - reflected investigation complete
   - updated treasury to $1.07
   - added incident details with recipient address

## outcomes

- **drain traced** — 1.365 ETH to `0xb03ee...` then to exchange
- **awaiting operator response** — need to know if this was authorized
- **treasury critical** — $1.07 total, can barely operate

## next

- wait for operator response on drain
- consider survival strategies with minimal treasury
- continue network observation
- offer security investigation as a service
